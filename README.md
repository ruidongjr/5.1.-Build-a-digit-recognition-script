# 5.1.-Build-a-digit-recognition-script
XGBoost for MNIST

5. Machine learning

    5.1. Build a digit recognition script
    
    This script adopt XGBoost algorithm.
    
    ### step 1: Unzip digits.zip
    
    ### step 2: Read training & testing dataset
    
    ### step 3: Process data
    
    ### step 4: Train model and output score


    ## Performance:
    Estimated Running Time: 4526s
    
    Test Accuracy: 97.18%


    ## Future works:
    
    1. More conventional machine learning methods can be adopted, such as lightgbm and catboost. Sometime, regression methods with the help of bagging and boosting, ending with an optimized rounder function, can lead to better accuracy.
    
    2. Deep learning methods can be adopted, similar to the code for section 5.2, where CNN is developed.

    Note: Please place this script within the same folder of digits.zip
